Power BI Dashboard - README
Welcome to my Power BI Dashboard repository! üìäüîç

Overview
I'm thrilled to share with you my second dashboard created in Power BI Desktop. This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of important business data, leveraging powerful data analysis techniques to unlock valuable insights.

Features
Key Metrics: The dashboard incorporates a range of key metrics and visualizations to provide insights into business performance.
Interactive Visualizations: Utilizing Power BI's intuitive interface, I've created interactive charts, graphs, and tables that dynamically showcase trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
Valuable Insights: Here are some of the insights derived from the dashboard:
The West Region dominates in terms of sales.
Office supplies are the most popular among consumers, followed by tech items.
Standard shipping mode accounts for around 58% of shipments, while Cash on Delivery (COD) is the preferred payment mode, comprising 43% of transactions.
Despite high sales in September and December, the maximum profit is observed in the months of March, October, and December.
